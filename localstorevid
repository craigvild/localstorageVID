 *
 * Summary: Copies Tealium visitor id cookie value to localStorage to create a more 
 *   durable anonymous visitor id.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 *   - This localStorage value will not be updated until the 1 year point
 *   - This JS Code below is copy/pasted to a JavaScript Extension in Tealium iQ 
 *     with an "All Tags" scope
 * 
 * Note:
 *   - Many vendors support mapping of visitor id, use the tealium_visitor_id for
 *   mapping to override each vendor's visitor id (configure mapping where needed).
 *   - This solution does not attempt to write back over the current cookie value that
 *   may contain a different tealium_visitor_id.  Code shows how to update the 
 *   tealium_visitor_id to default to the value retrieved from localStorage.  The data 
 *   layer would then contain the most-likely-to-be-consistent value.
 *   - While this technique can be used for more than just an anonymous id, remember
 *   that any PII information is best kept out of client-side cookies and localStorage
 *
